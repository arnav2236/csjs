# Computer Science in JavaScript

  Small collection of basic CS Algorithms/Data Structures in JavaScript.

  This project started out by me wanting to play around with CSS variables but then I just went bananas and wrote some algorithms (and some other [crazy stuff]()).

  If you're interested in these topics, [definitely checkout the much better version of this project.](https://github.com/nzakas/computer-science-in-javascript/)

## Algorithm Implementation/Optimization Hints

  - BubbleSort (`do/while`, no need to go past the last swapped element)
  - InsertionSort (we can stop searching as soon as we find insertion point)

## Generic Optimization Hints

  - Make sure not to (unnecessarily) revisit already visited data.
